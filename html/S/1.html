<a id='L3' name='L3'></a>
<a id='L4' name='L4'></a>The original source release was made using the ``DEICE.EXE``
<a id='L5' name='L5'></a>installer (DeIce) in the root directory.  (Basically a way to
<a id='L6' name='L6'></a>split self-extracting zip files over multiple floppy disks.)
<a id='L7' name='L7'></a>After execution, that installer will create the contents of
<a id='L8' name='L8'></a>the ``WOLFSRC`` directory.  In the "installed" directory, the
<a id='L9' name='L9'></a>the ``README.TXT``, ``RELEASE.TXT``, and ``LICENCE.DOC`` reside
<a id='L10' name='L10'></a>in the ``README`` directory.  They are duplicated below.

<a id='L17' name='L17'></a>-----------
<a id='L18' name='L18'></a>
<a id='L19' name='L19'></a>::
<a id='L20' name='L20'></a>
<a id='L21' name='L21'></a>  We are releasing this code for the entertainment of the 
<a id='L22' name='L22'></a>  user community.  We don't guarentee that anything even 
<a id='L23' name='L23'></a>  builds in here.  Projects just seem to rot when you leave 
<a id='L24' name='L24'></a>  them alone for long periods of time.
<a id='L25' name='L25'></a>
<a id='L26' name='L26'></a>  This is all the source we have relating to the original 
<a id='L27' name='L27'></a>  PC wolfenstein 3D project.  We haven't looked at this 
<a id='L28' name='L28'></a>  stuff in years, and I would probably be horribly embarassed 
<a id='L29' name='L29'></a>  to dig through my old code, so please don't ask any questions 
<a id='L30' name='L30'></a>  about it. The original project was built in borland c++ 3.0.  
<a id='L31' name='L31'></a>  I think some minor changes were required for later versions.
<a id='L32' name='L32'></a>
<a id='L33' name='L33'></a>  You will need the data from a released version of wolf or spear 
<a id='L34' name='L34'></a>  to use the exe built from this code.  You can just use a 
<a id='L35' name='L35'></a>  shareware version if you are really cheap.
<a id='L36' name='L36'></a>
<a id='L37' name='L37'></a>
<a id='L38' name='L38'></a>  Some coding comments in retrospect:
<a id='L39' name='L39'></a>
<a id='L40' name='L40'></a>  The ray casting refresh architecture is still reasonably 
<a id='L41' name='L41'></a>  appropriate for the game.  A BSP based texture mapper could 
<a id='L42' name='L42'></a>  go faster, but ray casting was a lot simpler to do at the time.
<a id='L43' name='L43'></a>
<a id='L44' name='L44'></a>  The dynamically compiled scaling routines are now a Bad Thing.  
<a id='L45' name='L45'></a>  On uncached machines (the original target) they are the fastest 
<a id='L46' name='L46'></a>  possible way to scale walls, but on modern processors you just 
<a id='L47' name='L47'></a>  wind up thrashing the code cash and wrecking performance.  
<a id='L48' name='L48'></a>  A simple looping texture mapper would be faster on 486+ machines.
<a id='L49' name='L49'></a>
<a id='L50' name='L50'></a>  The whole page manager caching scheme is unecessarily complex.
<a id='L51' name='L51'></a>
<a id='L52' name='L52'></a>  Way too many #ifdefs in the code!
<a id='L53' name='L53'></a>
<a id='L54' name='L54'></a>
<a id='L55' name='L55'></a>  Some project ideas with this code:
<a id='L56' name='L56'></a>
<a id='L57' name='L57'></a>  Add new monsters or weapons.
<a id='L58' name='L58'></a>
<a id='L59' name='L59'></a>  Add taller walls and vertical motion.   This should only be 
<a id='L60' name='L60'></a>  done if the texture mapper is rewritten.
<a id='L61' name='L61'></a>
<a id='L62' name='L62'></a>  Convert to a 32 bit compiler.  This would be a fair amount 
<a id='L63' name='L63'></a>  of work, but I would hate to even mess with crusty old 16 
<a id='L64' name='L64'></a>  bit code.  The code would get a LOT smaller.
<a id='L65' name='L65'></a>
<a id='L66' name='L66'></a>  Make a multi-player game that runs on DOOM sersetup / ipxsetup drivers.
<a id='L67' name='L67'></a>
<a id='L68' name='L68'></a>
<a id='L69' name='L69'></a>  Have fun...
